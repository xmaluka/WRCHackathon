User object location --> refers to user location specified by user (could be when they made the account)

First priority (user_tag , if unavailable user specified location)
** This runs into inefficiencies as for cases where user specified location and geo-location
   are present we observe a discrepancy between the two values --> Operators will be chasing 'red herrings'
** If geo-location not avalable --> Narrow it by municipal boundry and sites mentioned --> compare with users location
   -->If no hits -->ask user to share location/address
   --> If hits ask user for location/address?? 
** This is where auto response will help us
